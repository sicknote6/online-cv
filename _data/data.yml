    intro: >
       Throughout my 17 years in Liberty IT I have been the Tech Lead on many different applications with
       completely different architectures. Below are some of my recent projects.
    assignments:
      - title: Distribution Capabilities Platform
        tagline: "Add paragraph from wiki"

      - title: Home Oasis2
        tagline: "A new digital UI and Quoting Platform in support of new Home rating program. I was driving force behind the Serverless First mindset.
        Core Technologies used: ReactJS, Apollo, JavaScript, TypeScript, CDK, ApiGateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, DocumentDB, SNS, SQS, Datadog"

      - title: Bundling MVP
        tagline: "An MVP solution to quickly plug a gap in Liberty's bundling offering which was consciously created with the Omega2 roll-out. I was the lead developer across 2 teams in Boston and Belfast tasked
        with creating an MVP solution to allow online bundling of Omega2 quotes within 6 months. We successfully designed, implemented and delivered a product to production in under four months.
        Our solution proved so successful that the Bundling Best-in-Class project was then de-prioritised in favour of Home Oasis2
        Core Technologies used: React, Apollo, JavaScript, ApiGateway, Lambda"

      - title: Auto Omega2
        tagline: "A range of new APIs to support quote and bind capabilities for the new Auto Omega2 rating program. These APIs were initially built to support the Direct Sales UI however due to the success of the project were later then utilized by other
        distribution channels within Liberty. Core Technologies: Java, Spring Boot, Docker, Elasticache"

      - title: CodeGreen
        tagline: "Enablement project, tasked with improving the performance and stability of our Direct Sales application whilst also looking
        to improve and optimise our developer experience. One of my favourite projects from which I created the MockServer which is still heavily utilised in Direct Sales today
        Core Technologies used: Java, MongoDB, Express, Bash, Saucelabs, ..."
