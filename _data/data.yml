    title: Projects
    intro: >
       Throughout my 17 years in Liberty IT I have been the lead developer on many business critical projects. Below are some of my recent projects.
    assignments:
      - title: Distribution Capabilities Platform
        link: ""
        tagline: "The Distribution Capabilities Platform is made up of value-added services that enhance
        our insurance quoting process to make it easier, faster, and more seamless for a customer, agent,
        or third party to get a quote and bind a policy. The capabilities built within this platform support all of our distribution channels
        to ensure we build once, use many to unlock speed and efficiency for all of Distribution.
        Technologies used: ApiGateway, Lambda, EventBridge, DocumentDB, DynamoDB, OAuth, JWT, Kubernetes, TypeScript, Kafka, ElasticSearch, Elasticache"

      - title: Home Oasis2
        tagline: "Following on from the success of the Auto Omega2 program I was tasked with leading the effort to build a new Direct Sales UI and
        Quoting Platform in support of a new Home rating program. I took the lead role in designing our Architecture for this project and was the driving force behind
        us taking a Cloud Native Serverless First approach.
        Technologies used: ReactJS, Apollo GraphQL, JavaScript, TypeScript, CDK, ApiGateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, DocumentDB, SNS, SQS, Datadog, Bamboo Specs"

      - title: Bundling ( MVP & Best in Class )
        tagline: "With the roll-out of the Auto Omega2 project our business partners made a conscious decision that quote bundles wouldn't be supported initially.
        I was the lead developer across 2 teams in Boston and Belfast tasked with implementing an MVP solution to plug the gap.
        We successfully designed, implemented and delivered a product in less than four months.
        Our solution proved so successful that the Bundling Best-in-Class project was then de-prioritised in favour of Home Oasis2
        Technologies used: React, Apollo, JavaScript, ApiGateway, Lambda, Splunk"

      - title: Auto Omega2
        tagline: "A suite of new stateless APIs to support quote and bind capabilities for the new Auto Omega2 rating program.
        These APIs were initially built to support the Direct Sales UI however due to the success of the project were later then utilized by other
        distribution channels within Liberty. Technologies used: Java, Spring Boot, Docker, Elasticache, Splunk"

      - title: CodeGreen
        tagline: "Enablement project, tasked with improving the performance and stability of our Direct Sales application whilst also looking
        to improve and optimise our developer experience. Was only a 6 month engagement however a number of the processes and artifacts we created
        are still core to the continued success of the DirectSales application. The MockServer that we created has also been used across a number of future projects
        (eg Omega2, Oasis2 etc )
        Technologies used: Javascript, MongoDB, Express, Bash, Saucelabs, WebdriverIO, Mocha, Bamboo, Splunk"
