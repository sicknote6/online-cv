    title: Projects
    intro: >
       Throughout my 17 years in Liberty IT I have been the Technical Lead on many different applications with
       a range of different architectures. Below are some of my recent projects.
    assignments:
      - title: Distribution Capabilities Platform
        tagline: "The Distribution Capabilities Platform is made up of value-added services that enhance
        our insurance quoting process to make it easier, faster, and more seamless for a customer, agent,
        or third party to get a quote and bind a policy. The capabilities built within this platform support all of our distribution channels
        to ensure we build once, use many to unlock speed and efficiency for all of Distribution.
        Technologies used: ApiGateway, Lambda, EventBridge, DocumentDB, DynamoDB, OAuth, JWT, Kubernetes, TypeScript, Kafka, ElasticSearch, Elasticache"

      - title: Home Oasis2
        tagline: "Following on from the success of the Auto Omega2 program I was tasked with leading the effort to build a new Direct Sales UI and
        Quoting Platform in support of a new Home rating program. I took the lead role in designing our Architecture for this project as
        we looked to adopt a Cloud Native Serverless First mindset.

        with creating an MVP solution to allow online bundling of Omega2 quotes within 6 months. We successfully designed, implemented and delivered a product to production in under four months.
